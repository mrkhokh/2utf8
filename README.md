There are cases when old Java files contain multiple encodings — for example, a single file might include both Windows-1251 and UTF-8. In such situations, converting the file to one specific encoding often results in some lines being properly converted while others become corrupted. This plugin helps resolve such issues by safely converting Java files (or entire folders containing Java files) to UTF-8 only.

Using the plugin is simple: just select a file or folder, right-click it, and choose the "Convert to UTF-8" option — that's it! All lines with different encodings, as well as the file itself, will be correctly detected and converted to UTF-8
