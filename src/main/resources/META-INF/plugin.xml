    <description><![CDATA[
        There are cases when old Java files contain multiple encodings — for example, a single file might include both
        Windows-1251 and UTF-8. In such situations, converting the file to one specific encoding often results in some
        lines being properly converted while others become corrupted. This plugin helps resolve such issues by safely
        converting Java files (or entire folders containing Java files) to UTF-8 only.<br>

        <br>Using the plugin is simple: just select a file or folder, right-click it, and choose the "Convert to UTF-8"
        option — that's it! All lines with different encodings, as well as the file itself, will be correctly detected
        and converted to UTF-8.<br>
        <br>
